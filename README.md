A mobile application developed with React Native, Zustand, TanStack Query and TypeScript.  
This app allows store employees to log in, validate, and redeem purchase vouchers in real-time using a secure Django REST API with JWT authentication.

> It includes internal branding (such as the name "Intermart" and "Intermart Beau Plan") strictly for demonstration purposes only.  
> The app is not affiliated with or officially endorsed by Intermart for public distribution.
